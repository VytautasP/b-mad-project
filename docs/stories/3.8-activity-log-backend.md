# Story 3.8: Activity Log Backend

## Status

Draft

## Story

**As a** user,
**I want** the system to track all changes to tasks automatically,
**so that** I have an audit trail and history of what happened.

## Acceptance Criteria

1. ActivityLog entity created with fields: Id (GUID), TaskId (FK), UserId (FK), ActivityType (enum: Created/Updated/Deleted/StatusChanged/Assigned/Unassigned/TimeLogged/Commented), Description (string), ChangedField (nullable), OldValue (nullable), NewValue (nullable), Timestamp
2. Database migration created for ActivityLog table with indexes on TaskId and Timestamp
3. ActivityLogService created with method: LogActivity(taskId, userId, activityType, description, ...)
4. Activity logging triggered automatically via service layer hooks or database triggers for: task creation, task field updates, status changes, assignment/unassignment, time entry creation, comment creation
5. Activity descriptions human-readable (e.g., "Sarah changed status from In Progress to Done", "Marcus logged 2 hours 30 minutes")
6. Field-level change tracking for task updates (captures which field changed and before/after values)
7. API endpoint created: GET /api/tasks/:id/activity returns activity log sorted by Timestamp descending (most recent first)
8. Activity log pagination supported for tasks with extensive history
9. Activity log includes actor name for display ("John Doe assigned this task to Jane Smith")
10. Bulk operations (if implemented) log individual activities per affected task
11. Deleted tasks retain activity logs for audit purposes (or cascade delete based on design)
12. Performance: activity logging does not slow down task operations (async processing or fast inserts)
13. Unit tests verify activity creation for each trigger scenario
14. Integration tests validate activity log captures full workflow sequence

  - [ ] Confirm bulk behavior expectation in AC 10 is documented for current MVP scope (no dedicated bulk endpoint currently implemented)

## Dev Notes

### Existing System Integration

- Current backend has **no Activity Log implementation** yet:
  - No `ActivityLog` entity in `TaskFlow.Abstractions/Entities`
  - No `ActivityType` enum in `TaskFlow.Abstractions/Constants`
  - No activity repository/service/controller currently in place
- Primary integration touch points for automatic logging in current codebase:
  - `backend/TaskFlow.Core/Services/TaskService.cs`
  - `backend/TaskFlow.Core/Services/TimeEntryService.cs`
  - `backend/TaskFlow.Core/Services/CommentService.cs`
  - `backend/TaskFlow.Api/Controllers/TasksController.cs`

### Architecture and Contract References

- `docs/architecture/data-models.md` defines `ActivityLog` model shape and enum intent, including JSON old/new value tracking and timestamp ordering.
- `docs/architecture/database-schema.md` includes ActivityLogs schema and index strategy for chronological reads.
- `docs/architecture/api-specification.md` defines `GET /api/tasks/{taskId}/activities` (plural).
- Epic AC #7 specifies `GET /api/tasks/:id/activity` (singular). Implementer should reconcile this mismatch and keep API docs + frontend contract aligned.

### Existing Patterns to Follow

- **Entity + Configuration pattern**: mirror `Comment` and `CommentConfiguration` style for property mapping, FK behavior, and indexes.
- **Repository pattern**: mirror `CommentRepository` (`AsNoTracking`, include author relation where needed, deterministic ordering).
- **Service pattern**: mirror `TaskService` / `TimeEntryService` / `CommentService` (constructor DI, `IUnitOfWork`, `ILogger<T>`, explicit validation and exceptions).
- **Controller pattern**: mirror `TasksController` route structure and `GetCurrentUserId()` usage for authenticated user context.
- **Unit of Work pattern**: extend `IUnitOfWork` and `UnitOfWork` lazy repository properties consistently.
- **DI pattern**: repositories in `RepositoryExtensions`, services in `Program.cs`.

### Testing

**Frameworks and Tooling in Current Repo:**
- Backend tests use xUnit + Moq (`backend/TaskFlow.Tests/Unit/Services/*Tests.cs`)
- Integration tests use `CustomWebApplicationFactory` + authenticated `HttpClient` (`backend/TaskFlow.Tests/Integration/Controllers/*Tests.cs`)

**Testing Standards (from `docs/architecture/12-coding-standards.md`):**
- Every service method MUST have unit tests
- Every repository method MUST have unit tests
- Components/services with business logic MUST have tests
- Arrange-Act-Assert pattern

**Story-Specific Testing Requirements:**
- Validate activity entries are produced for each required trigger path
- Validate ordering (newest first) and pagination behavior for activity endpoint
- Validate no regressions on task, assignment, time entry, and comment operations
