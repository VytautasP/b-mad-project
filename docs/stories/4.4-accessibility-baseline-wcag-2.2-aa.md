# Story 4.4: Accessibility Baseline (WCAG 2.2 AA)

## Status

Approved

## Story

**As a** keyboard and assistive technology user,
**I want** consistent accessible behavior across core workflows,
**so that** I can complete key tasks without barriers.

## Acceptance Criteria

1. Text and control contrast meets WCAG AA targets in list, modal, details, and timeline views.
2. All icon-only actions expose accessible names and visible tooltips where needed.
3. Keyboard navigation order and focus indicators are consistent across key screens.
4. Minimum touch target size is 44x44px on mobile/tablet for interactive controls.
5. Core flows pass automated accessibility checks and manual keyboard-only validation.

## Tasks / Subtasks

- [ ] Audit and fix contrast tokens in affected components.
- [ ] Add ARIA labels for icon-only actions.
- [ ] Standardize focus ring and tab order behavior.
- [ ] Ensure touch targets meet minimum size.
- [ ] Add axe/Lighthouse checks for core routes.
