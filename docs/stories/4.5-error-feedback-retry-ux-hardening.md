# Story 4.5: Error Feedback and Retry UX Hardening

## Status

Approved

## Story

**As a** user,
**I want** clear and actionable error feedback,
**so that** I can recover quickly when partial data fails to load.

## Acceptance Criteria

1. Section-level failures (for example comments) show inline error and retry action.
2. Global error toasts avoid obscuring primary controls.
3. Retry behavior is idempotent and does not duplicate user actions.
4. Loading and empty states are visually distinct from errors.

## Tasks / Subtasks

- [ ] Add inline retry components for partial-load sections.
- [ ] Reposition or queue toast notifications to avoid overlap.
- [ ] Harden retry handlers to prevent duplicate requests.
- [ ] Add UX copy for loading/empty/error distinctions.
