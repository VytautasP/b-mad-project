# Story 4.8: UX Performance Optimizations for Dense Views

## Status

Approved

## Story

**As a** power user,
**I want** fast response in dense list and timeline views,
**so that** large task sets remain usable.

## Acceptance Criteria

1. List interactions remain responsive under larger datasets (sorting/filtering/pagination).
2. Non-critical details load progressively in Task Details page.
3. Skeleton states appear for slow sections instead of blank containers.
4. Timeline interactions avoid heavy rendering bottlenecks.

## Tasks / Subtasks

- [ ] Optimize list rendering strategy and expensive recalculations.
- [ ] Lazy-load non-critical detail sections.
- [ ] Add skeleton loaders for async regions.
- [ ] Profile and tune timeline interaction/render hotspots.
