# Story 2.3: Drag-and-Drop Task Reparenting

## Status

Ready for Review

## Story

**As a** user,
**I want** to drag tasks in the tree view to change their parent,
**so that** I can reorganize my project structure easily.

## Acceptance Criteria

1. Drag-and-drop functionality enabled on tree view nodes using Angular CDK Drag-Drop or tree library's built-in support
2. Dragging task shows visual feedback (ghost image, drop zones highlighted)
3. Dropping task on valid parent updates ParentTaskId via API PUT /api/tasks/:id/parent
4. Dropping task on root area (not on another task) removes parent (sets ParentTaskId to null)
5. Invalid drop targets prevented (cannot drop task on itself or its descendants)
6. Visual indicators show valid vs. invalid drop zones during drag
7. Successful reparenting updates tree view immediately without full page reload
8. API validation prevents circular references and enforces depth limit during reparenting
9. Error messages displayed for invalid reparenting attempts ("Cannot move task under its own child")
10. Undo toast notification displayed after reparenting with "Undo" action (optional enhancement)
11. Drag-and-drop works smoothly without lag for trees with 50+ tasks
12. Mobile users have alternative method to reparent tasks (edit form with parent selector dropdown)

  - [ ] Test with different browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Safari)

## Dev Notes

### Story Context

This story builds directly on Story 2.2 (Task Tree Visualization), which implemented the TaskTreeComponent using Angular Material Tree. Story 2.1 (Recursive Hierarchy Backend Support) already implemented the backend API endpoints needed for reparenting:
- PUT /api/tasks/:id/parent (set parent)
- DELETE /api/tasks/:id/parent (remove parent)

These endpoints include validation for circular references and depth limits (max 15 levels).

### Existing System Integration

**Frontend Component to Enhance:**
- File: [src/app/features/tasks/task-tree/task-tree.component.ts](src/app/features/tasks/task-tree/task-tree.component.ts)
- File: [src/app/features/tasks/task-tree/task-tree.component.html](src/app/features/tasks/task-tree/task-tree.component.html)
- File: [src/app/features/tasks/task-tree/task-tree.component.scss](src/app/features/tasks/task-tree/task-tree.component.scss)

**Service to Extend:**
- File: [src/app/core/services/task.service.ts](src/app/core/services/task.service.ts)
- Add methods: `setParentTask()`, `removeParent()`

**Backend API Endpoints (Already Implemented in Story 2.1):**
- PUT /api/tasks/:id/parent (body: { parentTaskId: string })
- DELETE /api/tasks/:id/parent
- Validation: Circular reference prevention, depth limit (15 levels)

**Technology Stack:**
- **Drag-Drop Library**: Angular CDK Drag-Drop (already installed as @angular/cdk dependency)
- **Tree Library**: Angular Material Tree (already used in Story 2.2)
- **Notifications**: Angular Material Snackbar (already available)
- **HTTP**: Angular HttpClient with interceptor for auth

**Existing Pattern to Follow:**
- TaskTreeComponent follows standalone component pattern
- Services use RxJS Observables
- Error handling via centralized HTTP interceptor
- Toast notifications via Angular Material Snackbar

### Key Constraints

1. **Integration with Angular Material Tree**: The drag-drop must work seamlessly with the existing tree structure. Angular CDK Drag-Drop can be integrated with custom tree implementations.

2. **Client-Side Validation**: Before calling API, validate that:
   - Task is not being dropped on itself
   - Task is not being dropped on its descendants (would create cycle)
   - This requires traversing the local tree structure

3. **Optimistic Updates**: Update the UI immediately after drop, then call API. Revert if API fails.

4. **Performance**: With 50+ tasks, ensure drag-drop is smooth:
   - Use `trackBy` function in tree rendering
   - Minimize DOM manipulations during drag
   - Consider virtual scrolling if performance issues arise (defer to future story)

5. **Accessibility**: Drag-drop is not keyboard accessible by default. The mobile alternative (parent selector dropdown) also serves as the accessible alternative for keyboard users.

6. **Undo Complexity**: Undo is marked as "optional enhancement" in AC 10. Implement if time permits, otherwise defer to future story.

### Testing

**Testing Standards:**
- **Test Location**: [src/app/features/tasks/task-tree/task-tree.component.spec.ts](src/app/features/tasks/task-tree/task-tree.component.spec.ts)
- **Framework**: Jasmine + Karma (Angular default)
- **Patterns**:
  - Use Angular CDK drag-drop testing utilities for simulating drag-drop
  - Mock TaskService using Jasmine spies
  - Mock MatSnackBar for notification testing
  - Test component logic, not DOM manipulation details
  - Focus on: validation logic, API calls, error handling, undo functionality
  
**Testing Approach:**
- Unit tests for component logic (validation, event handlers)
- Mock external dependencies (TaskService, MatSnackBar)
- Use Angular testing utilities (TestBed, ComponentFixture)
- Aim for 80%+ code coverage on new drag-drop logic

### Technical Notes

**Drag-Drop Implementation Approach:**
1. Add `cdkDropList` to tree container
2. Add `cdkDrag` to each tree node
3. Use `cdkDropListConnectedTo` for nested drop lists (parent nodes)
4. Implement custom drop logic in `cdkDropped` handler
5. Use CSS for visual feedback

**Alternative Considered:**
- @circlon/angular-tree-component has built-in drag-drop support, but we're already using Angular Material Tree from Story 2.2. Adding another library would increase bundle size. Stick with Angular CDK Drag-Drop for consistency.

**Validation Logic:**
```typescript
// Check if targetParentId is a descendant of draggedTaskId
function isDescendant(taskId: string, potentialDescendantId: string, tree: TaskNode[]): boolean {
  // Traverse tree recursively
  // Return true if potentialDescendantId found in subtree of taskId
}
```

**API Error Responses (from Story 2.1):**
- 400 Bad Request: Circular reference, depth limit exceeded
- 404 Not Found: Task or parent task not found
- 403 Forbidden: User doesn't own task
