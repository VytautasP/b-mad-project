# Story 4.2: List View Readability and Filter Simplification

## Status

Ready for Review

## Story

**As a** frequent user,
**I want** a cleaner list view with simplified default filters,
**so that** I can scan and act on tasks faster with less cognitive load.

## Acceptance Criteria

1. List rows have improved spacing/readability and maintain quick-action efficiency.
2. Default visible filters are Search and Status; advanced filters are collapsible.
3. Applied filters are shown as removable chips.
4. Primary/secondary action emphasis is clear (Create Task primary, clear secondary controls).
5. Actions column remains consistently aligned and discoverable.

## Tasks / Subtasks

- [x] Update table row spacing and visual hierarchy.
- [x] Implement collapsed/expanded filter panel behavior.
- [x] Add applied-filter chips with single-click removal.
- [x] Tune action button styles and placement.
- [x] Add regression checks for sort/filter/pagination behavior.

### Completion Notes List

- Refined list readability with increased table row/cell spacing and clearer top-level header/actions layout.
- Updated filter UX so Search and Status are always visible, with remaining filters moved to a collapsed Advanced Filters panel.
- Preserved and improved removable applied-filter chips by adding search-term chip coverage and single-click removal behavior.
- Added primary `Create Task` action and secondary `Clear Filters` control for clearer action hierarchy.
- Improved actions-column consistency by grouping task row actions in a fixed alignment container.
- Added regression test coverage for create action flow and updated filter-chip behavior.
