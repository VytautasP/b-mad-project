# Story 4.2: List View Readability and Filter Simplification

## Status

Approved

## Story

**As a** frequent user,
**I want** a cleaner list view with simplified default filters,
**so that** I can scan and act on tasks faster with less cognitive load.

## Acceptance Criteria

1. List rows have improved spacing/readability and maintain quick-action efficiency.
2. Default visible filters are Search and Status; advanced filters are collapsible.
3. Applied filters are shown as removable chips.
4. Primary/secondary action emphasis is clear (Create Task primary, clear secondary controls).
5. Actions column remains consistently aligned and discoverable.

## Tasks / Subtasks

- [ ] Update table row spacing and visual hierarchy.
- [ ] Implement collapsed/expanded filter panel behavior.
- [ ] Add applied-filter chips with single-click removal.
- [ ] Tune action button styles and placement.
- [ ] Add regression checks for sort/filter/pagination behavior.
