# Story 4.7: Motion and Micro-interaction Consistency

## Status

Approved

## Story

**As a** user,
**I want** subtle and consistent interaction feedback,
**so that** the interface feels responsive without distraction.

## Acceptance Criteria

1. Standard transitions are applied to view switches, modal open/close, and feedback states.
2. Motion durations remain short and consistent with the spec.
3. Reduced-motion preferences are respected.
4. Motion never blocks interaction completion.

## Tasks / Subtasks

- [ ] Implement shared motion tokens/variables.
- [ ] Apply transition patterns to core interaction points.
- [ ] Add reduced-motion media-query fallbacks.
- [ ] Validate perceived responsiveness in key flows.
