# Story 4.6: Responsive Layout Adaptation (Desktop/Tablet/Mobile)

## Status

Approved

## Story

**As a** user across devices,
**I want** layouts to adapt without losing critical actions,
**so that** I can manage tasks effectively on desktop, tablet, and mobile.

## Acceptance Criteria

1. Breakpoint behaviors align with defined ranges (mobile/tablet/desktop/wide).
2. Core actions remain visible and reachable on all breakpoints.
3. Content priority shifts correctly on smaller screens (task essentials first).
4. Drag-heavy interactions have reliable alternative controls on touch devices.

## Tasks / Subtasks

- [ ] Implement responsive layout rules for list/details/timeline.
- [ ] Validate action placement and sticky controls on smaller screens.
- [ ] Add alternative non-drag controls for touch constraints.
- [ ] Verify responsive behavior through viewport test matrix.
