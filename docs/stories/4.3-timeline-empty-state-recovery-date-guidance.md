# Story 4.3: Timeline Empty-State Recovery and Date Guidance

## Status

Approved

## Story

**As a** planner,
**I want** timeline empty states to explain next steps,
**so that** I can quickly add due dates and populate the timeline.

## Acceptance Criteria

1. Timeline empty state includes clear reason and a direct CTA to add due dates.
2. CTA navigates to relevant task date editing context and returns user to timeline.
3. Day/Week/Month selected state is visually clear and accessible.
4. Empty-state copy and CTA are present on desktop and mobile layouts.

## Tasks / Subtasks

- [ ] Build timeline empty-state component.
- [ ] Wire CTA to date-edit flow and return behavior.
- [ ] Improve selected-state visibility for timeline granularity toggles.
- [ ] Add validation for no-date and partial-date scenarios.
