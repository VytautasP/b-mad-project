# Epic List

## Epic 1: Foundation & Basic Task Management

**Goal**: Establish project infrastructure (authentication, database, API foundation) while delivering a functional task tracking system where users can register, create tasks, set priorities and statuses, and mark work complete�providing immediate value as a simple but working to-do system.

## Epic 2: Task Organization & Time Tracking

**Goal**: Enable professional project management through unlimited task hierarchy for organizing work into projects/milestones, multi-user assignment for team collaboration, and integrated time tracking (timer + manual entry) with automatic parent rollup�transforming the simple to-do list into a billable hours tracking and project organization tool.

## Epic 3: Advanced Views & Team Collaboration

**Goal**: Complete the professional task management experience by adding multiple data visualization methods (sortable/filterable list view and visual Gantt timeline) and team collaboration features (comments, mentions, activity log) that enable teams to coordinate work and stakeholders to track progress without requiring status meetings.
