# Goals and Background Context

## Goals

- Deliver a lightweight, hierarchical task management system that serves freelancers and small teams without enterprise tool complexity
- Enable integrated time tracking as a first-class feature, eliminating the need for separate time tracking tools
- Provide unlimited task nesting through recursive hierarchy to support projects of any complexity
- Create an intuitive interface requiring <5 minutes for new users to create their first task and start tracking time
- Build a freemium SaaS model with clear upgrade paths from solo use to team collaboration
- Achieve 1,000 active users within 6 months with 15% free-to-paid conversion

## Background Context

The task management tool market presents users with an impossible choice: sacrifice professionalism with oversimplified to-do lists or drown in the complexity of enterprise platforms like Jira, Monday.com, and Asana. Freelancers managing multiple client projects and small teams (3-7 people) need professional-grade capabilities�particularly time tracking for billing and task hierarchy for project organization�without spending hours on tool configuration and training.

TaskFlow addresses this gap through architectural elegance: a single recursive Task entity replaces rigid "project/epic/story/task" hierarchies, and built-in time tracking eliminates tool fragmentation. The MVP focuses on Freelance Sarah (independent consultant billing hourly) and Team Lead Marcus (managing small teams) personas, delivering essential functionality with progressive disclosure�solo features work immediately, team capabilities activate when collaborators are invited.
