## Story 4.1: Task Details Page + Quick Inspect Modal Split

### Status

Draft

### Story

**As a** task manager,
**I want** a dedicated Task Details page for deep work and a lightweight modal for quick inspection,
**so that** I can move quickly for simple checks without losing a full workspace for complex task operations.

### Acceptance Criteria

1. A dedicated route-based Task Details page is available from list, tree, and timeline contexts.
2. Quick Inspect modal shows summary-only fields (title, status, priority, due date, assignees, short description).
3. Quick Inspect modal includes a single clear action to open full Task Details page.
4. Deep actions (full comments thread, detailed activity, full time management) are only on Task Details page.
5. Focus and keyboard behavior are correct (Escape closes modal, focus returns to opener).

### Tasks / Subtasks

- [ ] Add Task Details route and page shell.
- [ ] Build Quick Inspect modal with summary data contract.
- [ ] Add "Open full details" navigation from modal.
- [ ] Move deep edit/time/comment actions to details page.
- [ ] Add keyboard/focus behavior tests for modal and route transition.

## Story 4.2: List View Readability and Filter Simplification

### Status

Draft

### Story

**As a** frequent user,
**I want** a cleaner list view with simplified default filters,
**so that** I can scan and act on tasks faster with less cognitive load.

### Acceptance Criteria

1. List rows have improved spacing/readability and maintain quick-action efficiency.
2. Default visible filters are Search and Status; advanced filters are collapsible.
3. Applied filters are shown as removable chips.
4. Primary/secondary action emphasis is clear (Create Task primary, clear secondary controls).
5. Actions column remains consistently aligned and discoverable.

### Tasks / Subtasks

- [ ] Update table row spacing and visual hierarchy.
- [ ] Implement collapsed/expanded filter panel behavior.
- [ ] Add applied-filter chips with single-click removal.
- [ ] Tune action button styles and placement.
- [ ] Add regression checks for sort/filter/pagination behavior.

## Story 4.3: Timeline Empty-State Recovery and Date Guidance

### Status

Draft

### Story

**As a** planner,
**I want** timeline empty states to explain next steps,
**so that** I can quickly add due dates and populate the timeline.

### Acceptance Criteria

1. Timeline empty state includes clear reason and a direct CTA to add due dates.
2. CTA navigates to relevant task date editing context and returns user to timeline.
3. Day/Week/Month selected state is visually clear and accessible.
4. Empty-state copy and CTA are present on desktop and mobile layouts.

### Tasks / Subtasks

- [ ] Build timeline empty-state component.
- [ ] Wire CTA to date-edit flow and return behavior.
- [ ] Improve selected-state visibility for timeline granularity toggles.
- [ ] Add validation for no-date and partial-date scenarios.

## Story 4.4: Accessibility Baseline (WCAG 2.2 AA)

### Status

Draft

### Story

**As a** keyboard and assistive technology user,
**I want** consistent accessible behavior across core workflows,
**so that** I can complete key tasks without barriers.

### Acceptance Criteria

1. Text and control contrast meets WCAG AA targets in list, modal, details, and timeline views.
2. All icon-only actions expose accessible names and visible tooltips where needed.
3. Keyboard navigation order and focus indicators are consistent across key screens.
4. Minimum touch target size is 44x44px on mobile/tablet for interactive controls.
5. Core flows pass automated accessibility checks and manual keyboard-only validation.

### Tasks / Subtasks

- [ ] Audit and fix contrast tokens in affected components.
- [ ] Add ARIA labels for icon-only actions.
- [ ] Standardize focus ring and tab order behavior.
- [ ] Ensure touch targets meet minimum size.
- [ ] Add axe/Lighthouse checks for core routes.

## Story 4.5: Error Feedback and Retry UX Hardening

### Status

Draft

### Story

**As a** user,
**I want** clear and actionable error feedback,
**so that** I can recover quickly when partial data fails to load.

### Acceptance Criteria

1. Section-level failures (for example comments) show inline error and retry action.
2. Global error toasts avoid obscuring primary controls.
3. Retry behavior is idempotent and does not duplicate user actions.
4. Loading and empty states are visually distinct from errors.

### Tasks / Subtasks

- [ ] Add inline retry components for partial-load sections.
- [ ] Reposition or queue toast notifications to avoid overlap.
- [ ] Harden retry handlers to prevent duplicate requests.
- [ ] Add UX copy for loading/empty/error distinctions.

## Story 4.6: Responsive Layout Adaptation (Desktop/Tablet/Mobile)

### Status

Draft

### Story

**As a** user across devices,
**I want** layouts to adapt without losing critical actions,
**so that** I can manage tasks effectively on desktop, tablet, and mobile.

### Acceptance Criteria

1. Breakpoint behaviors align with defined ranges (mobile/tablet/desktop/wide).
2. Core actions remain visible and reachable on all breakpoints.
3. Content priority shifts correctly on smaller screens (task essentials first).
4. Drag-heavy interactions have reliable alternative controls on touch devices.

### Tasks / Subtasks

- [ ] Implement responsive layout rules for list/details/timeline.
- [ ] Validate action placement and sticky controls on smaller screens.
- [ ] Add alternative non-drag controls for touch constraints.
- [ ] Verify responsive behavior through viewport test matrix.

## Story 4.7: Motion and Micro-interaction Consistency

### Status

Draft

### Story

**As a** user,

### Acceptance Criteria

1. Standard transitions are applied to view switches, modal open/close, and feedback states.
2. Motion durations remain short and consistent with the spec.
3. Reduced-motion preferences are respected.
4. Motion never blocks interaction completion.

### Tasks / Subtasks

- [ ] Implement shared motion tokens/variables.
- [ ] Apply transition patterns to core interaction points.
- [ ] Add reduced-motion media-query fallbacks.
- [ ] Validate perceived responsiveness in key flows.

## Story 4.8: UX Performance Optimizations for Dense Views

### Status

Draft

### Story

**As a** power user,
**I want** fast response in dense list and timeline views,
**so that** large task sets remain usable.

### Acceptance Criteria

1. List interactions remain responsive under larger datasets (sorting/filtering/pagination).
2. Non-critical details load progressively in Task Details page.

4. Timeline interactions avoid heavy rendering bottlenecks.

### Tasks / Subtasks

- [ ] Optimize list rendering strategy and expensive recalculations.

## Suggested Delivery Sequence

1. Complete P0 stories 4.1-4.3 first (highest user-visible UX gains).
2. Execute P1 stories 4.4-4.6 in parallel where team capacity allows.
3. Close with P2 stories 4.7-4.8 for polish and long-term maintainability.
